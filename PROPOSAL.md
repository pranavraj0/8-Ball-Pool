Put your final project proposal here.

I want to make a game similar to the app 8 Ball Pool. This app is a game 
which simulates billiards, with two players playing, or one player playing against a random AI. 
As with any other pool game, the objective for each player is to hit all the balls of their side into a net
using the cue. The pool cue can be pulled at various speeds and angles.

I don't really have a background on this game, rather than playing copious amounts of it as a child. 
However, it is one of my favorite mobile games and I think it would be fun and challenging to recreate it. 
Generally, though, for the structure of the game itself, a lot of the physics of the balls will be similar to the ideal
gas MP we had, and I can take cues from that in order to develop the physics of the game.

Timeline:
Week 1: Design look/ UI of pool game and begin to work on mechanics and physics of pool cue.
Week 2: Finish mechanics and physics of pool cue and work on mechanics and physics of balls on table.
Week 3: Create rules to enforce game by, and add finishing touches to game. 

Stretch Goals:
Adding different designs for balls and cue. Having different cues with different physics. Adding more game modes.
